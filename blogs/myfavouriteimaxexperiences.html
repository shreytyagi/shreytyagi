			<h3>My Top 5 Most Memorable IMAX Experiences</h3><p>IMAX has given me my most memorable cinema experiences and will continue to be my go to for special movies. This post touches upon my top 5 most memorable experiences in short. So, I’ve had 39 IMAX visits so far (33 different movies). Out of all of them, only two visits ever made me feel emotional because of the surreal audio visual experience. Yes, the “fidelity” made me emotional, not the movie’s story!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first was #Avatar (2022 re-release in IMAX 3D at Select CityWalk, Delhi). I had the best possible seat. The 3D was clean, the colors were vibrant, the picture was bright, and the sound was crisp. During the tree destruction scene, I remember just sitting there, stunned, thinking, “I can’t believe cinema can feel this good.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second was #Sinners (2025) during my third watch (first was Select Citywalk, which was decent) at Priya IMAX. They had increased the brightness for this dark-looking film, and it made a world of difference. It was noticeable brighter than SCW IMAX. When the “I Lied to You” sequence ended, my heart was beating at a dangerously fast pace. I was almost about to cry. The pristine visuals, the moving powerful 12-channel sound, and the massive field of view just overwhelmed me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>#Titanic 3D (2023 re-release) at Select CityWalk, despite being scope throughout, looked bright and beautiful. During the ship-sinking scene, I remember being thrilled to the core.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>#Interstellar 2025 re-release at Priya IMAX felt far more impactful than my previous watch at Select CityWalk in 2023. The new DCP was much better, and the venue had superior sound and field of view. I was having a blast!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>#MissionImpossibleTheFinalReckoning at Priya had thunderous moving 12-channel sound and incredible immersion. I genuinely enjoyed the sound design throughout the entire film.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These five are my top IMAX memories. But only Avatar 3D (at Select CityWalk) and Sinners (at Priya) made me feel something deep… just because the experience was that good.</p>
