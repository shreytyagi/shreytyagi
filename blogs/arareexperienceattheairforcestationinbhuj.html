<h3>A Rare Experience at the Air Force Station in Bhuj</h3>

<p>Thanks to my <b>Tauji</b>, who is a <i>Warrant Officer in the Indian Air Force</i>, I had the rare opportunity to visit the <b>Air Force Station in Bhuj</b>. He arranged special permission for us, making this visit an unforgettable experience. His office was quite <b>big</b>, and from there, we were taken to different parts of the base.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting moments was seeing the <b>runway</b> and the parked aircraft. Some aircraft had <i>grass on top for camouflage</i>, a fascinating technique to make them blend into the surroundings. But the highlight of the visit was the detailed demonstration of a <b>Jaguar fighter aircraft</b>.</p>

<p>Initially, some <b>airmen</b> explained various aspects of the aircraft. Later, a <b>pilot arrived</b>, likely on the orders of the <b>Commanding Officer (CO)</b>, whom we met briefly for a simple <i>hi-hello</i>. The pilot’s explanation was an extremely <b>rare opportunity</b>, as he shared intricate details about the aircraft’s systems, avionics, and weapons.</p>

<p><b>Exploring the Jaguar Fighter Aircraft</b></p>

<p>The Jaguar aircraft has several unique features. At the very front, there is a <b>big stick-like structure</b> with something hanging like a <i>flag</i>, which helps indicate wind direction or air pressure. Below that, there is a <b>sensor</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>wings</b> contain <i>fuel storage units</i>. Each wing has two <b>holders</b>, which can carry different equipment. The <b>inside holder</b> can hold <i>missiles</i>, <i>weapons</i>, or <i>extra fuel tanks</i>. The extra fuel is used <b>first</b>, and only after it is depleted, the fuel from the wings is consumed. These extra tanks can also be <b>dropped</b> if needed. However, the <b>outside holder</b> can only carry <i>missiles</i>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the aircraft can carry <b>three extra fuel tanks</b>: one under each wing and one below the aircraft’s body. The <b>wings</b> also have <i>small sticks</i> designed to <b>discharge static electricity</b>, which builds up when passing through clouds.</p>

<p>At the rear, there are <b>two engine exhausts</b> that expel <i>fire</i>. These <b>exhaust openings</b> can expand. On the front side of the wings, there is an <b>air intake</b> that was <i>closed</i> on the ground to prevent birds or debris from entering. However, it opens during flight.</p>

<p>A yellow <b>staircase</b> is used by pilots to climb into the cockpit. First, the airman and pilot climbed up, and then I followed. Inside, the pilot began explaining the <b>cockpit controls</b>.</p>

<p><b>Inside the Jaguar’s Cockpit</b></p>

<p>The <b>joystick</b> is used for <i>3D steering</i>, allowing full control over movement. To the left of the pilot’s seat, there is a <b>throttle</b>, which controls how much fuel enters the engine. The more fuel that goes in, the faster the aircraft moves.</p>

<p>The cockpit is equipped with several <b>complex avionics controls</b>. The instruments include a meter that shows <i>altitude</i>, one that indicates <i>horizon tilt</i>, and another that measures <i>drift while turning</i>. There is also a speedometer, an <b>altimeter</b> that displays height above sea level, and a <b>ground proximity meter</b> that measures height from the ground.</p>

<p>For example, if the aircraft is flying at <i>10,000 meters above sea level</i> while passing over an <i>8,000-meter-high mountain</i>, the sea-level altimeter will read <b>10,000 meters</b>, but the ground proximity meter will indicate <b>2,000 meters</b>, ensuring precise altitude tracking.</p>

<p>The pilot also explained the aircraft’s <b>communication system</b>. It has <b>two connectivity channels</b>: one for <i>ground control</i> and another for a different function. The volume of these communication channels can be adjusted.</p>

<p>Near the throttle, there is a special <b>control</b> where the pilot must insert <i>two fingers</i> to activate a <b>speed boost</b>. This provides a sudden burst of acceleration. When I jokingly asked if this would allow the aircraft to reach <i>Mach 10</i>, the pilot laughed and said it was impossible, mentioning that such speeds are only seen in movies.</p>

<p>To the right of the cockpit, there were more <b>complex controls</b> that I couldn’t fully understand. Below the pilot’s seat is the <b>ejection system</b>, which is extremely dangerous. If triggered on the ground, the pilot would be launched into the air and fall back down, which could be fatal.</p>

<p>The cockpit is <b>very tight and claustrophobic</b>. The instrument panel is positioned flat, with all critical information being <b>projected onto a glass screen</b> at a <i>45-degree angle</i>. This allows the pilot to view both the readings and the sky at the same time, similar to how <i>Iron Man’s Jarvis</i> appears as a projection in mid-air.</p>

<p><b>Other Areas We Explored</b></p>

<p>During the visit, we also got to see the <b>pilots’ dressing room</b>, a <b>mini-museum</b> inside the Air Force office building, a <b>briefing room</b>, and a <b>projector room</b>. Later, we returned to <b>Tauji’s office</b>, where we were served <b>tea</b> and met his <b>subordinate</b>, who was from <i>Mathura</i>.</p>

<p><b>A Close Encounter with a Commercial Aircraft</b></p>

<p>One thing I was hoping to see was a <b>commercial aircraft</b>. Initially, there was no fixed schedule for one, so I wasn’t expecting it. However, just as we were leaving, we had an <b>unexpected and intense experience</b>.</p>

<p>Our car was approaching a <b>crossing where the road intersected with the aircraft taxiway</b>. Suddenly, a <b>Vistara commercial aircraft</b> came taxiing towards us, preparing for takeoff. There were <b>no barricades or safety measures</b>, making it a <i>dangerous moment</i>. We were nearly on a collision course before we quickly stopped, watching as the aircraft took off just meters away.</p>

<p>This moment was a complete <b>surprise</b> and made the visit even more thrilling. What started as an opportunity to see military aircraft turned into an experience where I also witnessed a commercial takeoff up close.</p>

<p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p>

<p>This visit to the <b>Air Force Station in Bhuj</b> was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. From learning about the <b>Jaguar fighter jet</b> in such detail to unexpectedly witnessing a commercial takeoff so close, every moment was incredible. A huge thanks to <b>Tauji</b> for making this possible!</p>
