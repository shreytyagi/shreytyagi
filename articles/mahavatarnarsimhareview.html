			<h3>Mahavatar Narsimha 3D Hindi Review</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 27 Jul, 2025<p>
			<p>Mahavatar Narsimha 3D Hindi Review – A Beautiful Masterpiece of an Animated Movie Ruined by AI’s Horrendous 2D-to-3D Conversion and Uncomfortable AI Face Swapping</p>

<p>Before I elaborate on the long list of flaws, please first know that this is a superbly imagined movie with jaw-dropping cinematography, stylish camera work, beautiful visuals, intelligent screenplay, fast-paced editing, classy action, and commendable direction. The shot selection feels very cinematic.</p>

<p>Although the animation quality clearly looks low-budget in many scenes, you can see the care and effort that went into creating everything. It is truly enjoyable to watch and remains engaging throughout. The dialogues, music, and sound effects are the strongest elements. It’s such a feel-good yet heart-wrenching film that I couldn’t help but join my hands and chant “Om Namah Bhagavate Vasudevaya” during the climax scene.</p>

<p>Now, that said, here are the unfortunate massive flaws:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AI-Enhanced Faces Look Unpleasant</strong><br>
    They have used AI to enhance the faces of most human-like characters (except the demons), especially the eyes. This makes the faces look overly artificial and unpleasant. The uncanny valley effect is very strong in most scenes featuring those characters. Even the demons appear to have slight AI enhancement in their eyes in some moments.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>AI Lip-Sync Is Inconsistent</strong><br>
    They have attempted to use AI for syncing the lip movements with the dialogues. This effort is a hit and miss. At times, the lip movements appear strange and unnatural.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Noticeable Frame Drops and Judder</strong><br>
    There are frequent frame drops and visible judder throughout the movie. This gives the film a low-quality feel and becomes distracting after a point.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Terrible 2D-to-3D Conversion</strong><br>
    This is not a native 3D movie. It was originally rendered in 2D and later put through a low-grade AI 2D-to-3D conversion software. The result is the worst 3D experience I have ever seen. The 3D is not just poor, it is fundamentally wrong. Backgrounds sometimes appear in the foreground. Depth is assigned incorrectly to random objects. Edges of objects are surrounded by rotoscoping artifacts. At certain times, it feels completely flat. Other times, it turns into a disorienting and messy 3D hallucination. This creates a huge distraction for anyone familiar with how proper 3D should work. Casual viewers may simply feel that wearing 3D glasses reduces the blur and accept it as fine. In reality, the 3D is a terrible flaw that ruins the charm of an otherwise beautiful animation.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Gimmicky Black Bars and Frame Breaks</strong><br>
    In many scenes, the filmmakers have added black bars to the top and bottom with objects appearing to break through the frame. This suggests that some design effort went into planning for a 3D experience. Ironically, there is no proper 3D effect… only the frame breaks. The size of the black bars keeps changing, which makes the whole thing look gimmicky. This creative choice felt completely unnecessary and even irritating.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Poor Framing for Scope Aspect Ratio</strong><br>
    Although the film is presented in scope (2.39:1), it was clearly designed in a taller aspect ratio. As a result, several shots suffer from poor headroom, with character heads getting cropped more than they should. This makes the framing feel awkward and careless.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
Please watch this movie. It is visually and emotionally powerful. However, do not watch it in 3D, not even by mistake. Choose the 2D version instead so you can enjoy the story without all the distractions.</p>

<p>This movie now comes first in my WORST 3D EXPERIENCE list.</p>
