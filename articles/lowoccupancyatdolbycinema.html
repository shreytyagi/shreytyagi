			<h3>Dolby Cinema, Pune - A curious case of why occupancies are too low?</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Rohith Kumar • 8 Jul, 2025<p>
<ul>
  <li>The matter of pricing has consistently been a significant consideration for the exhibitors.</li>
  <li>While some might attribute it to a lack of awareness, based on my numerous discussions with friends outside of X, it appears that they simply do not express any interest.</li>
  <li>The value proposition in comparison to IMAX.</li>
  <li>Geographical aspect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's elaborate on each front.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing :</strong></p>
<p>Their Screen 7 has a 4K Laser Projection with Dolby Atmos and Screen 6 is Dolby Cinema which has a Dual Laser projection capable of projecting Dolby Vision cinema and 60+ channel Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>The movie F1 is creating waves all accross the industry, posting great occupancy numbers even after 10 days of its release. It's currently listed in both Screen 6 and Screen 7.</p>
<p>While the screen 7 at City Pride is posting decent occupancies with a standard ticket price ranging from ₹150-₹250, their Screen 6 which is Dolby Cinema costs around ₹450-₹500 for their standard seating option is struggling to post good numbers.</p>
<p>How many people out there would spend double or triple when the choices are great and "great better" because Screen 7 in itself is a pretty solid option, isn't it?</p>
<p>And this is the same city where both the IMAXes are posting solid numbers for this film despite costing ₹350-₹450.</p>

<p><strong>Awareness :</strong></p>
<p>There's a saying "When you're too used to the mid, even average starts to feel like excellence."</p>
<p>We, as a society, have been fed mediocre or subpar cinema over the years that we've simply accepted is good for us. Nearly 10 years ago, my hometown got its first Multiplex & 2 years later, its first PVR. Once they opened, I still recall my dad saying:</p>
<p>"I can't go to regular theatres now, my eyes hurt"</p>
<p>and ever since then, they have become the standard here. I recently visited these venues and they've become so old, my eyes hurt but a lot of people don't seem to care anyways since they're still better than the other single screens in the city.</p>
<p>There used to be a time when I watched a lot of movies on the giant Prasads 70mm IMAX with my dad back in the day which we seem to have forgotten and we've adapted to the new substandard normal.</p>

<p><strong>IMAX vs DC :</strong></p>
<p>Let's jump back to discussing about F1 movie.</p>
<p>IMAX is playing the entire movie runs in 1.90 expanded aspect ratio while standard theatres and Dolby Cinema are playing it in a Scope ratio.</p>
<p>So, even if you're a movie buff, which one would you pick? Absolute best HDR or expanded aspect ratio? And I think this will be the case for a lot of future releases too, since IMAX doesn't share its DCPs.</p>
<p>Now I don't know how good the city's IMAXes are but one cannot deny that IMAX is a big name brand while people barely know or understand Dolby Cinema fully. One will obviously compare both because IMAX has always been the standard and Dolby Cinema is priced on par with it.</p>

<p><strong>Geography :</strong></p>
<p>I am certainly not qualified to comment on the geography of the city and the location of Dolby Cinema, but from a quick Google Maps search, I understand that the nearest IMAX location is 20 km away from City Pride, Kharadi, and another one is 27 km away. That must account for something.</p>
<p>Again, happy to be corrected on this point.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Thoughts :</strong></p>
<p>I really hope more people find out about this new format and like it. Then, it could make as much money as IMAX, or even more! If one venue and a new format do well, it'll open the door for even newer formats, more cities getting cool cinema options, and a better cinema standard all over the country!</p>
<p>Please feel free to share your opinion. Let's up the cinema standard across the country!</p>
