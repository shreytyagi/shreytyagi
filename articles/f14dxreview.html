			<h3>F1 4DX and Movie Review</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 28 Jun, 2025<p>
			<p>It’s the same stereotypical sports movie story, already done hundreds of times before. A “once-great” protagonist makes a comeback and struggles his way up. The story has no surprises, no complex characters, and no unpredictability. Many plot points, like the protagonist who is wise but arrogant in his ways, and a competitive junior who doesn’t accept his mentorship, are directly copied from Top Gun: Maverick. Overall, I really didn’t find the story fresh at all. I’m not saying that the story is bad, in fact, it did keep me engaged throughout… but it’s nothing new.</p>

<p>This movie is technically a visual masterpiece. The racing scenes are some of the best-looking shots I’ve ever seen in any movie. They feel very immersive and intimate. The shots are very stylish, stable, well planned. The color-palette is very consistent. If the director’s intention was to present the most professional looking F1 shots ever, he achieved that with flying colours.</p>

<p>As for surround sound, the directional sound effects were underwhelming. I expected the surrounds to be loaded with cars zipping around, but the shots weren’t designed to take advantage of that. Therefore the mixing for sound effects was mostly front-heavy. All I could hear in the surrounds was the commentary and music.</p>

<p>The Hindi dub was excellent. It is one of the finest dubs I have heard. Viraj Adhav’s voice as Brad Pitt is done very professionally, well suited and soothing to the ears. Some jokes could have landed better in English but overall, it kept the essence of the movie intact.</p>

<p>4DX was underwhelming. Although the seat movements were synced nicely with the moving cars, they felt exaggerated and unnatural. This is again because the shots were cut rapidly and did not suit the 4DX format. To be honest, 4DX didn’t spoil the experience, but it didn’t enhance it much either. On the other hand, movies like How to Train Your Dragon suited 4DX very well and truly enhanced the experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water effects were used quite a few times.</li>
  <li>Snow was used once for confetti.</li>
  <li>Lightning was used for sparking.</li>
  <li>Scent was used a few times.</li>
  <li>The seats were active only during races.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recommended in 4DX? Yes, but not strongly. Prefer IMAX or similarly large screens with bright 4K and deep bass.</p>
