			<h3>Superman Movie Review</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 11 Jul, 2025<p>
<p>I really liked how smartly this reboot has been handled by James Gunn. It felt just like MCU did in Spider-Man Homecoming, where they didn’t waste time redoing the origin story. Same here. They never show how Superman came from another planet or how his parents died, but all of that is still there in the background, told very subtly. So even if someone has never seen a Superman movie, they’ll get the idea, and for people who have already seen the origin a million times, it won’t feel repetitive. The story jumps right into the present but still keeps you emotionally connected. They don’t formally introduce Lois Lane, Lex Luthor or any characters, but somehow you start understanding them naturally while watching. It doesn’t even feel like a reboot. You can just imagine this as a continuation of Man of Steel with a new cast and it will still work perfectly. That’s the best part.</p>

<p>Because think about it, how many times will you show a new world that doesn’t have superheroes and then there is one and then many more… we have seen those progressions many times in many movies now. Just deal with it — there is this Earth and there are superheroes here, that’s it! There are many new characters and meta-humans in this world, but they just exist, and Gunn has placed them so naturally that it doesn’t feel forced at all. Within 15 minutes you feel like you know this world already.</p>

<p>At the heart of it, the story is about Superman figuring out his purpose and dealing with emotions and how the world sees him. Yes, he needs to save the world and we know he will eventually save the world — what’s new about that? That’s why the story is such that we are more worried about Superman’s emotions and his journey of self-exploration more than him saving the world.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the story is also about Lex Luthor dealing with similar emotions in his own way (you notice that in the end). That emotional angle really connects with today’s generation because we all somewhere care about how we’re perceived. Even with all the larger-than-life elements, the movie feels grounded.</p>

<p>Now talking about action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The flight scenes are super well done. The camera stays very close to Superman, the POV shots make you feel the speed and intensity, and it actually feels like he’s flying.</li>
  <li>The visuals are colourful and bright — exactly how they should be in a Superman film.</li>
  <li>Lots of wide-angle shots are used, but very close to the actors’ faces, with soft blur in the background. It gives a very intimate feel.</li>
  <li>Gunn isn’t scared of keeping the camera right in the actor’s face, and that really helps in making us feel their emotions.</li>
  <li>The humour is nice — not dark like the old DC movies. It’s colourful, light and fun just like it should be.</li>
  <li>Music is great too.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hindi dub is also very well done. Some jokes have been adapted to Indian references and honestly it didn’t feel odd at all. I still want to watch it once in English just to compare, but even in Hindi, it felt like a serious professional job.</p>

<p>Overall I genuinely loved the film. It felt new, yet familiar, emotional but fun, and something I’d happily rewatch in theatres at least three times. James Gunn has done a brilliant job with this one.</p>

<p>Overall an action-filled cinematic experience with a good story I thoroughly enjoyed!</p>
