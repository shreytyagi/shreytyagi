			<h3>Ballerina 4DX and Movie Review</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 14 Jun, 2025<p>
			<p>I’ve seen all #JohnWick films but only vaguely remembered the story… so maybe why I couldn’t connect much. Felt like a bland Bollywood-style revenge drama.</p>

<p>Action/fights were solid. Sound mix was front-heavy except during action… great directional effects (gunshots, voices moving in surround).</p>

<p>Hindi dub was fine, except for two poorly voiced kids.</p>

<p>4DX was thrilling: blasts, hits, throws synced perfectly with motion seats. They timed it in a way that they slowly dip the seats (without letting us know) before major impacts, and then used that for a sharp bounce &amp; tilt back... this was really exciting and masterfully done. Lightning, snow (used thrice), wind &amp; smoke added well.</p>

<p>Recommended in 4DX? Yes, but not strongly. I feel it could be better on a bigger screen with deep bass.</p>
