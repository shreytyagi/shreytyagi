			<h3>Crazxy - Movie Review</h3>
	<p>
		Given that Sohum Shah was behind Tumbbad and Ship Of Theseus, I had high expectations with Crazxy. A stylish opening introduces the plot where Sohum must deliver 5cr for an important task, while simultaneously dealing with his kidnapped daughter, also demanding the same amount.
	</p>
	<p>
		This parallel narrative created an engaging sense of thrilling suspense, leaving viewers guessing if it is a coincidence or were these two connected… However, as the movie progressed, it became increasingly dull, excitement goes down as nothing interesting really happens.
	</p>
	<p>
		The climax was underwhelming and unintentionally funny, especially as it attempted to address a certain social issue, which I think they ended up mocking instead. The acting by Soham was lackluster with minimal expressions and range, making it hard to connect with his character.
	</p>
	<p>
		The songs in the later half of the movie, which although only run in the background, were randomly placed and did not help the movie. The movie’s concept had potential and could’ve been something excellent, but due to lazy writing in second half and even lazier acting… it fails!
