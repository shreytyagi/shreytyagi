			<h3>Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani</h3>
				<p>
		The fact that a Karan Johar directorial is coming to cinemas was sufficient to get me excited. But I did not expect that the movie is going to be so so good! Read on to know why!
	</p>
	<p>
		The movie starts with a quick introduction to the main characters followed by a party song which will take you by surprise. The story proceeds and you get proper Karan Johar movie vibes. This was missing in his previous directorial, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Everyone's performance is good but it is Ranveer's perfection that keeps you hooked. The story feels fresh considering the kind of romance films we have been getting lately. But 30 minutes into the film you realise that this romance is a side-track and family drama takes the center stage throughout the rest of the movie. This is why I would recommend you to watch it with your family.
	</p>

		This is an important film every Indian must watch. With it's brilliant script, it gives a very strong message that will jolt you. It is fresh, entertaining and has the right blend of drama, comedy, romance and emotions. It's technically brilliant. It looks and sounds great. I noticed that the picture looked AI enhanced in a way that there was no grain and there is a slight oil painting look. As for parental guidance, there is one indirect sex joke in a conversation using Indian classical beat notations. There are few uses of words like "Intercourse" and "Orgasm" and "Lund" in a non-sexual and out of context manner. There are few uses of the abusive words like "Bhen Di" and "Bhencho". There is one erotic rain dance sequence, some casual making out scenes and plenty of kissing scenes. So some people might get a little uncomfortable but such never last long enough so majority of Indian audience would be fine watching along with family (just check out the ceiling when required ha ha).

		Karan Johar as a director is back and this will go down as one his better films.
