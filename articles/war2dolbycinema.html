			<h3>War 2 in Dolby Cinema</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 9 Aug, 2025<p>
			<p>War 2 becomes world’s first Indian Hindi movie to be released in Dolby Cinema format.</p>

<p>This is ALSO the first Indian Dolby Cinema format movie to be released in Dolby Cinema format in India (as Dolby Cinema opened in India just a few weeks ago). But this is NOT the first Indian movie to get a Dolby Cinema format release because Indian Telugu movies #RRR, #Pushpa2 and #GameChanger released in Dolby Cinema format overseas already (not in India).</p>

<p>The movie is set to release in 3 weeks which is why I think it might be an SDR to HDR post conversion instead of native HDR. Nevertheless it would be much better this way than to show normal SDR DCPs (non-Dolby Cinema formatted) in Dolby Cinema screens. The movie is being graded in Dolby Vision at @AnnapurnaStdios in Hyderabad.</p>

<p>People of Pune MUST NOT MISS this Dolby Cinema experience at Citypride, Kharadi. Prefer Dolby Cinema over IMAX since there is no expanded ratio in this movie and @YRF does great Atmos mixes.</p>

<p>Hindi cinema, especially YRF studio, loves 2K DCPs. But as a shocking exception this time, as far as I got to know, #War2 will most likely get a 4K HDR DCP for Dolby Cinema venues. The non-VFX shots are native 4K resolution while the VFX shots are done in 3K resolution.</p>

<p>IMAX too will get a 4K DCP, but for that, I can’t confirm if that’ll be true 4K, i.e., if a 4K master has been sent to IMAX by YRF. Because even if IMAX receives 2K content, they always upscale to 4K before making a DCP.</p>
