			<h3>Superman 3D Review</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 11 Jul, 2025<p>
<p>Just watched this for the second time (English this time) on the same PXL flat screen in CP67 Mohali (also the same seat), so I think I have sufficient experience now to give my opinion on the 3D. This movie is a perfect example of how 3D can actually add value, without necessarily needing those gimmicky pop-out effects. The shots are crafted in a way that 3D clearly enhances the experience (not like Jurassic World: Rebirth where 3D was not adding any value).</p>

<p>Here’s what stood out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are tons of close-ups using special wide-angle lenses that focus really close, which gives a soft background blur. In 3D, these faces look much more dimensional (sculpted). You can feel the curve of the nose, the eyes, and the distance from the background.</li>
  <li>Many fight scenes also use crazy camera angles that move in and out or spin around, and those movements feel so much better with 3D depth.</li>
  <li>Even the aerial shots are composed with 3D in mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven’t seen the 2D version, but I completely understand why James Gunn said he prefers the 3D version. The film is extremely bright — so bright that in many shots, highlights are completely blown out with no detail. But this brightness works in 3D’s favor. Even on the dullest 3D screens, this film won’t look dim. You can wear two pairs of 3D glasses and still not feel the brightness is low. That’s how bright it is.</p>

<p>As for the stereo conversion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s mostly very good. No artifacts anywhere.</li>
  <li>Most shots that could benefit from 3D do benefit from it.</li>
  <li>The depth feels inconsistent. Some close-ups have amazing depth, while many long shots (zoomed-in shots) or some (not all) over-the-shoulder shots have noticeably lower depth.</li>
  <li>Many stereo supervisors use hyper stereo in those shots to add more parallax, but they haven’t done such things here — that’s the only area I feel could’ve been improved.</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, in some wide shots like the ones showing Jarhanpur mob or that epic opening shot, they do use hyperstereo, and you can clearly feel multiple layers in the image. Those moments really shine apart from the close-ups that I loved the most.</p>

<p>Overall, I won’t call it the best 3D conversion ever. Films like Deadpool 3, GOTG2, Avengers Endgame and Thor Ragnarok had stronger stereo depth. But this one is still really good because the content and style of this movie so strongly suits 3D! Definitely worth watching in 3D at least once. Good job, DNEG!</p>
