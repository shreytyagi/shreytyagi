			<h3>Dolby Cinema Pune: Complete In-Depth Review</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 5 Jul, 2025<p>
			<p>This is such a new and premium technology for India that it would be disrespectful to reduce it to a small write-up. So I request you to unblock 20 minutes time from your day and read this entire article which took me 7 hours to write! I promise, it will answer all your questions and you won’t be able to resist sharing it further!</p>
			<p>—————</p>
			<p>The Dolby Cinema at City Pride Multiplex, Kharadi, Pune is India’s first Dolby Cinema and screened its first feature movie (F1) on 3rd July 2025.</p>
			<p>So firstly, those who don’t know about Dolby Cinema, please don’t confuse it with Dolby Surround, Dolby 5.1, Dolby 7.1 or Dolby Atmos because those are separate sound-only technologies which have been in India for decades. Dolby Cinema is something entirely different because it uses Dolby Vision technology for projecting movies in HDR at cinemas, which is a huge achievement! Furthermore, they are able to achieve nearly pure blacks and extreme contrast ratios that no other cinema technology can even come close to (except ONYX/Luxon LED cinemas, but they can’t be compared with this since Dolby Cinema is a projection technology). The entire audi of Dolby Cinema is designed by Dolby themselves. So not only the sound, but also architecture, seats, colours, screen, projectors, speakers… each and everything is designed by Dolby.</p>
			<p>Please note that ONLY the audi 6 is Dolby Cinema. Audi 7 has a 4K laser projector with Dolby Atmos sound but that audi is NOT a Dolby Cinema. Audi 1-5 don’t even have Dolby Atmos sound. So for Dolby Cinema, make sure you’re booking tickets for audi 6.</p>
			<p>It features an unusual 2.1:1 aspect ratio screen which does NOT go floor to ceiling but does go wall-to-wall. The width as measured by me and Kaustubh Debnath using a laser measuring device came out to be approximately 55ft wide and 26.2ft tall. This is a hybrid between 2.39:1 and 1.85:1. So neither flat ratio nor scope ratio content can fill the screen. But both ratio content will have very small black bars. The projector and system have been designed to automatically adjust based on DCP ratio. It, however, does not have adjustable lens and CANNOT do a custom zoom to fill the screen if the movie is 2:1 or 2.1:1 inside a flat 1.85:1 container. So if the movie is 2.39:1, it will cover the width; if the movie is 1.85:1, it will cover the screen height; but if the movie is inside a container with hardcoded black bars, the movie will be window-boxed.</p>
			<p>This cinema uses dual 4K laser projectors that support up to 4K HDR 120fps in 3D as well as 2D. The projectors can go much brighter but are limited to 108 nits (31 foot Lamberts) for HDR presentations. That’s the peak brightness which the provided content is mastered to be played at.</p>
			<p>Since it supports 88% Rec.2020 colourspace, they use proprietary Dolby Wide Colour Gamut which can show much deeper shades of colours than P3 colourspace (which all other cinemas use).</p>
			<p>This cinema has a 61-channel Dolby Atmos sound setup (29.18.14). There are 5 full-range front speakers and 10 front-subwoofers (2 below each of these speakers) behind the screen. Then there are 9 speakers on the left wall, 9 on the right wall, 6 on the back wall and 18 speakers on the ceiling. There are 2 surround-left subwoofers and 2 surround-right subwoofers. The special thing is that all the surround speakers and subwoofers are hidden behind the acoustically transparent wall (except 2 back-center speakers near the projector). The audi has a spaceship-style dual door entrance where there is kind of an airlock in between and you have to open two doors to enter the audi. This isolates all possible sound from the lobby area or other auditoriums.</p>
			<p>The floor, ceiling, seats, walls… everything is darkest matte black, because it helps in the contrast ratio. Due to government mandate, they had to put blue strips on stairs but they face upwards, so have minimal interference with screen. Plus, they dim the strips during the movie.</p>
			<p>The seats here are NOT the same premium seats which Dolby Cinema is famous for in USA. Also, their famous butt-kicker bass vibration system is NOT used in these seats. They‘re just above average comfortable seats. PVR PXLs have better seats!</p>
			<p>The seating is not very steep but steep enough to prevent heads blocking the screen. Actually, Dolby Atmos sounds good if the audi is deeper, there is a longer side wall to show off the pin point accuracy of audio objects. But deep audis have to sacrifice seating steepness to be able to adjust enough rows till the end. Due to the same reason, the screen doesn’t feel as immersive as IMAXs. But this doesn’t mean that it looks small. Sit half way back and screen looks huge, you don’t have to tilt your head up either.</p>
			<p>One of the most important aspects is 3D. Since Dolby Cinema uses dual projectors, there is no alternate flickering that happens in IMAX with Laser and RealD. This makes the 3D smoother. Further, it uses sophisticated colour filter technology in the 3D glasses which is superior to the circular polarised technology used with most new 3D laser projectors. Due to the quality and high-end technology there is absolutely zero ghosting and no noticeable loss in brightness. It looks as good in 3D as in 2D!</p>
			<p>There is something also special about the way Dolby Cinema handles motion. 24 fps content feels judder free even in shaky scenes or fast panning scenes. Sometimes it almost feels like HFR even if it isn’t.</p>
			<p>—————</p>
			<p>I visited the Dolby Cinema on 3rd and 4th July and was fortunate enough to see 10 demos and 2 movies in HDR! Below is the detailed account of everything they showed and how the experience for each of them was!</p>
			<p>1. Dolby Cinema Universe (Demo Trailer in 2D Scope 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>Since it was Dolby’s demo, it definitely looked and sounded good. However, since it barely had any real footage, hard to appreciate or understand HDR. It was like a bright, colourful and contrast-rich demo with a lot of moving audio elements and some deep bass moments.</p>
			<p>2. Top Gun: Maverick (Darkstar Take-Off Clip in 2D Scope 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>HDR and wide colour gamut became slightly more noticeable here… in reflections on Cruise’s helmet, specular highlights on the plane’s body, the display screens on the plane, etc. Fake film grain emulation was strongly noticeable and so were the true 4K details. Sound was loud and thundering, there weren’t enough of them but there definitely were some not-so-obvious overhead effects.</p>
			<p>3. Dune: Part Two (Spice Harvester Attack Clip in 2D Scope 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>HDR was not that noticeable here but since I’ve studied Dune: Part Two too many times in IMAX in SDR and at home in Dolby Vision, I knew that highlight details are getting recovered very well here in Dolby Cinema. But otherwise, to the untrained eye, it would just look like a super bright version, not HDR. The sound was the highlight here. It was loud but still no distortion at all, very crystal clear and satisfying. Audio objects could be distinctly felt at different locations of the audi.</p>
			<p>4. The Batman (Penguin Car Chase Clip in 2D Scope 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>This is the scene where the blacks were shown off. This is a movie infamous for being too dark and hardly anything being visible in night shots. But here at Dolby Cinema, it felt like a different movie altogether. It was dark yet so clearly visible, pleasing to the eye, nobody can complain. The 4K detail, the colours and the specular highlights were decently noticeable in the car lights and explosions. But the Atmos sound is what blew my mind away. I have never experienced audio so immersive. When the car crashes and tumbles, it felt like I was inside it! Sound rotated top to right to bottom to left like a front-load washing machine! And when finally there is a scene where suddenly a car flies and falls in front of the screen, it clearly swooshes from the back to top and then ends in the front. Undoubtedly the best Atmos experience of my life in these 5 minutes.</p>
			<p>5. Darkest Hour (Churchill’s Speech Clip in 2D Flat 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>This is a clip where they again showed off every aspect of their projector. The scene when the room goes all red, there’s a red bulb that shines and appears super HDR bright. The reds in the room and the face are so deep red that it is simply not possible with P3 colorspace only… you do need Rec.2020 colourspace here. And also pure red is the toughest colour to show brightly, so that’s where HDR helps again. The shadows in some scenes were extremely dark, yet you could see various shades of grey, without straining your eyes! Sound was not the key highlight of this clip, but dialogues were crispy! I loved this demo the most.</p>
			<p>6. Barbie (Dance The Night Clip in 2D Flat 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>Yet another HDR + Rec.2020 show-off but now in a bright scene. All the colours pop, yet the faces have absolutely perfect skin tones. The dance scene has lights go on and off again and again, some lights shining and shimmering in the background. They all took full advantage of HDR and looked very pleasing. Sound was not the highlight of the clip but the music did have some Atmos effects here and there.</p>
			<p>7. Pushpa 2 The Rule (Sooseki Telugu Song Clip in 2D Scope 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>I have seen this movie in Dolby Vision at home and I hated it because the contrast ratio is too high, so blacks get crushed if your device is not premium enough. My TV struggles a lot with the shadows of Pushpa 2 in Dolby Vision. This is something also mentioned by the guy who was hosting the event for us; he said that this movie has a very high contrast ratio. But here is the thing: this is Dolby Cinema and it was a cakewalk for it to handle such high contrast grading. Everything in this clip… the shadow detail, the contrast, the colours, the 4K detail, the specular highlights (from reflections off the ornaments, background lights) looked spectacular! It can be treated as an AV demo for high-end devices and projectors. I noticed many Atmos object effects too in the music (including one overhead panning). I wish I could see the whole movie once in Dolby Cinema, it was that good!</p>
			<p>8. Spider-Man: No Way Home (Electro’s Entry Clip in 3D Scope 2K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>This is again one of those super dark infamous scenes, where even in IMAX I struggled to see anything clearly. On my Bravia in Dolby Vision, I can only hear stuff but can’t see anything, it’s THAT dark. But in Dolby Cinema… what is dark? It was handling this scene in HDR so comfortably that I was shocked this time even more than with The Batman clip. And oh, this was 3D, which should ideally become an abomination for a super dark scene, right? But even with the glasses on, there was negligible loss of brightness. You’ll have to check many times to realise the 2–3% dimming. And the most important thing is that 99% projectors produce ghosting (double images even with glasses on) in 3D if the scene is too dark with a small bright element. That’s exactly what happens when Electro appears in this super dark scene. You know, I tried my best to look at every corner of the screen, every element, every angle possible… but couldn’t find any ghosting… not even 0.1% of ghosting. How can they achieve the absolute perfect 3D? That’s partially also because of the colour filter technology they use for 3D (instead of the polarised filters in other cinemas). Among all the clips shown, this was the most challenging clip to do in 3D, and Dolby Cinema passed with “flying colours”. The Dolby Atmos sound was also pretty good, although I didn’t feel any overheads, there were plenty of object-based effects in the 2D space which were exciting enough.</p>
			<p>9. The Super Mario Bros. Movie (Rainbow Car Chase Clip in 3D Scope 2K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>This was the second 3D test, but in a bright and vibrant scene. Since this is a native 3D animation, the 3D enhanced the 3D shape of these three dimensional animated characters. Of course, there was again no ghosting, but what this scene showed off more was the wide colour gamut. The characters were riding a rainbow! Every possible colour in the world was there on it, and it looked absolutely delicious to watch. I don’t recall any standout overhead effects in this clip but the sound was very enjoyable, clean, and full.</p>
			<p>10. Dolby Cinema Universe 3D (Demo Trailer in 3D Scope 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>This was the 3D version of the same demo shown in the beginning. The live-action shots were clearly post-converted from 2D to 3D. Other CGI shots could very well have been natively rendered in 3D. But the main thing is that I felt no loss in contrast, colours, or brightness in the 3D version; reassuring that 3D and 2D both are equally good in this cinema. 3D doesn’t affect the picture or colour quality in Dolby Cinema, unlike IMAX where colours and brightness visibly get duller after wearing glasses.</p>
			<p>11. F1 (Entire Movie in 2D Scope 4K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>This is a movie by Apple: the real HDR junkies! And as expected, the HDR in this movie blew me away. It’s actually funny that this movie was wayyyy better than every demo shown before. Throughout the demos, I kept feeling like “Okay, you are showing HDR, and I can feel it a bit, but why can’t I feel the kind of HDR-popping specular highlights which I feel on OLED TVs? Like those sparkling kind?” Well… I felt exactly that kind of HDR in this movie. The clouds were shining in HDR and highlights were getting recovered (I can say that because I have already seen this movie once in 2K Laser 5.1). Every tube light, every lamp, every light in the stadium and on the cars, was SHINING… just as it is supposed to be in HDR. The overall brightness of scenes did not go very bright (which many HDR graders notoriously do). Raising the overall scene brightness for a long time can cause pain in the eyes. So instead of raising the full scene’s brightness, it was throughout kept in a comfortable range and graded in a way that only the specular highlights went beyond the SDR range… creating a “dynamic” and realistic image while not hurting the eyes. This was reference-level HDR, which you can show to new learners and tell them: “See, that’s how HDR is done!”. Dolby Cinema proved that it can make you feel, using a projector, the same kind of HDR you feel on OLEDs. The 4K too was reference level here. No unnecessary fake film emulation to ruin detail… just crispy clean true 4K. Doing such crisp 4K with dual projectors is tough because laser alignment needs to be done, and no matter how precise you do it, even half a millimeter offset can reduce the sharpness (according to me). So despite being a dual projection system, it is the sharpest projection I have ever seen… sharper than every premium cinema and IMAX I have ever been to!</p>
			<p>Now about the Atmos sound in F1. On my first viewing of F1 in 5.1, I had complained that the mix hardly used any effects like zipping cars around in surround. But here, in this highly calibrated Atmos system, I realised that there actually were a decent number of such effects… just that they were very subtle and could be missed easily on sub-par systems. But not here. In Dolby Cinema, you can actually hear the detail in sound, just like the director intended. I know this is the kind of cheeky line brands use to sell their sound technologies, but I’m getting a firsthand experience of it now. Cars did zip around in surround. Not just cars, there was a shot of inside the car (facing Brad Pitt) and with each turn his car took, crowd cheer changed direction from side left to side right! There was a scene in the beginning with loads of fireworks, and they all popped in the height channels. The movie had a lot of super-loud moments but never became annoying since there is no distortion.</p>
			<p>But yeah, overall, although it was undoubtedly a weakly done Atmos mix, it was still able to sound very good because of the impeccable hardware, the calibration, and audi architecture. You know, I hadn’t liked the movie much in my first viewing in 4DX 2K Laser 5.1 in Mohali… but this time in Dolby Cinema, I ended up loving the experience! This speaks “volumes” about how much the experience matters for the story to be felt. I didn’t feel the craving for the expanded image we get in IMAX. After this experience, I have realised that given a choice between expanded image vs expanded dynamic range, I’d always choose the latter.</p>
			<p>12. Jurassic World: Rebirth (Full Movie in 3D Scope 2K HDR Atmos)</p>
			<p>As I have already highlighted the advantages of Dolby Cinema’s 3D before, the same applies for this entire movie too. It was a clean 3D image, no ghosting even in dark and challenging scenes. For example, in a dark scene when the character suddenly lights up a red flare, this could have easily faced ghosting issues in 3D, but not here. All dark scenes were comfortably visible with 3D glasses. The movie was shot on film, and you can immediately tell that this was a 2K DCP. But surprisingly, the 2K doesn’t look pixelated, it looks good despite not being as detailed as 4K. I don’t know what kind of upscaling their projection system uses internally, but it works better than IMAX’s 2K-to-4K upscaled DMR content. While IMAX does slight smoothening to make the pixels disappear on their 4K projectors, Dolby Cinema handles it in a way that looks much better.</p>
			<p>In this movie, the HDR is not as spectacular as in F1, it is not graded to look that way. But whenever needed, like specular highlights reflecting off car edges, or bright sun shining, bright red flares, etc., the HDR is taken advantage of. I feel that the HDR grading is very subtle for this movie, the colours do not pop much, and it is likely a stylistic choice and partially also because of the limitations of using film. Film cannot capture a lot of dynamic range. If a scene is in bright day, the shadows will be crushed and appear black with little to no detail. Similarly, there are numerous scenes where highlights could have been recovered in HDR: like the bright day visible outside the cave’s mouth, the clouds, hard sunlit faces; but this movie has all those things clipped and at many times it doesn’t even feel like HDR.</p>
			<p>Same goes for the 3D conversion. The movie was clearly not shot keeping 3D in mind, so there are almost no scenes that take much advantage of 3D. The parallax is not bad, especially in close-up shots and the shots where we see deep down from a mountain top. But despite that, the 3D feels average at best, partially because of the modest parallax in 3D conversion and partially because of the fact that the shots are not designed for 3D. But overall, due to the excellent 3D technology of Dolby Cinema, the 3D experience was still very satisfying. Dolby’s 3D glasses are big, premium and comfortable.</p>
			<p>The movie’s Dolby Atmos sound was not upto the mark though. Apart from few deep bass roars and few subtle directional effects, there were almost no overhead effects. The mix was front heavy. What stood out was the dynamic range in the sound, even the loudest roars were clear, absolutely no distortion.</p>
			<p>—————</p>
			<p>Conclusion:</p>
			<p>If I have to conclude Dolby Cinema in one word, it is “perfection”. LED cinemas might be able to achieve similar blacks, but the “feel” of a cinema is with projectors. And Dolby Cinema brings out the best in terms of content as well as hardware quality with their godly projectors. This is an ultra-premium audio-visual technology (IMAX is nowhere close). And those who are technically aware about how HDR and Atmos works, they are gonna fall in love with how Dolby Cinema does real magic!</p>
			<p>—————</p>
			<p>Thank you if you read this whole article. I travelled 68 hours in train from Chandigarh to Pune and back, ONLY for this Dolby Cinema, and I have written almost everything I could, in this article. I have not used any kind of AI at all gor writing this. I have tried to be as factually correct as possible but my apologies in advance if there are any errors.</p>
			<p>—————</p>
			<p>I would firstly like to thank Mr. Denzil Diaz for getting a Dolby Cinema DCP of F1 mastered for India specifically for this one-time show. He is the leading supporter and promoter of premium cinema formats in India with WB and Universal’s distribution.</p>
			<p>Then I’d like to thank the staff of Citypride Kharadi and the Dolby team for letting us record videos and take pictures of Dolby Cinema as much we wanted. They gave us all the information we wanted, and hosted us warmly.</p>
			<p>I would also like to thank my friends Mr. Aniket Bhosale, Mr. Dheeraj Deshmukh, Mr Kaustubh Debnath, Mr R Rahul and Mr. Chaturvedi for their help, guidance and support to make my Pune Dolby Cinema visit a success.</p>
			<p>I don’t know if and when I’d be able to visit a Dolby Cinema again, but the HDR and Surround Sound enthusiast in me is fully satisfied and is carrying core memories back to Chandigarh to cherish forever.</p>
