			<h3>Why Taking Full-Sized Trains to Kashmir Was Almost Impossible</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 2 Feb, 2026<p>
			<p>North India begins as flat land. From Delhi to Punjab, the ground is wide and level. Trains can move fast here. Height changes very little.</p>

<p>Near Jammu, the plains start to break. Low hills appear. The climb begins slowly.</p>

<p>After this, the land turns hard. Mountains rise sharply and deep gorges cut through the earth. Rivers flow far below. This mountain belt acts like a wall. It is the <strong>Pir Panjal</strong> range. Crossing this wall is the hardest part.</p>

<p>Once the wall is crossed, the land suddenly opens. The mountains fall away. A wide valley appears. This <strong>valley looks flat like plains</strong>. But it sits very high above sea level. It is an elevated plain surrounded by mountains. This is the Kashmir Valley.</p>

<p>For the longest time, nobody could even imagine trains reaching here. Until 2005, railways in India ended at <strong>Jammu Tawi</strong>. Beyond Jammu, there were only roads.</p>

<p>In 2005, trains climbed into the hills for the first time. Tracks reached <strong>Udhampur</strong>, at about 756 metres above sea level. The climb had begun.</p>

<p>In July 2014, railways reached <strong>SMVD Katra</strong>. This station sits at 825 metres. For nearly ten years, this was the last stop. The mountains ahead were too hard.</p>

<p>At the same time, railways were growing inside the Kashmir Valley itself.</p>

<p>In 2009, trains started running between <strong>Banihal</strong> and <strong>Qazigund</strong>. Later that year, they reached <strong>Srinagar</strong>. By 2013, trains went all the way to <strong>Baramulla</strong>.</p>

<p>But these trains running inside the Kashmir Valley were cut off from the rest of India. There was no rail link beyond the mountains.</p>

<p>Between Katra and Banihal lay just 111 kilometres. This short stretch was the hardest part.</p>

<p>Here, the Himalayas rise sharply. The rock is unstable and broken. Water flows inside the mountains. Many tunnels collapsed during construction. Several routes had to be changed. Progress was slow, but the line moved forward.</p>

<p>In 2020, <strong>Tunnel T-44</strong>, over 11 kilometres long, was completed. In April 2021, <strong>Tunnel T-50</strong> broke through. At 12.77 kilometres, it became the <strong>longest railway tunnel in India</strong>.</p>

<p>In the same month, steel met steel across the Chenab. The arch of the <strong>Chenab Rail Bridge</strong> was closed. At 359 metres above the river, it became the <strong>highest railway bridge on Earth</strong>.</p>

<p>Soon after, the <strong>Anji Khad Bridge</strong>, the <strong>second highest railway bridge of India</strong>, joined the cliffs of Reasi. India’s first cable-stayed railway bridge stood ready.</p>

<p>By 2023, tracks from Kanyakumari and Kashmir finally met.</p>

<p>At Banihal railway station, trains stand at about <strong>1,702 metres above sea level</strong>. This is the <strong>highest broad-gauge railway station in India</strong>.</p>

<p>Beyond Banihal, the wall ends.</p>

<p>The land opens into the Kashmir Valley. Srinagar rests at around 1,585 metres. A high valley. Flat, wide, and calm.</p>

<p>Once, trains did not exist here at all. Not in these gorges. Not under these mountains. Not in this valley.</p>

<p>Today, steel passes through the Himalayas. It crosses deep rivers. It reaches places once thought unreachable. This is why this railway feels different. It did not just connect places. It crossed a wall.</p>

<p>I am a train enthusiast and have travelled by train thousands of times. I cannot explain how proud I feel of my country and of the engineers who made this happen.</p>
