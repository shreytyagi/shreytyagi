			<h3>How To Train Your Dragon 4DX &amp; Movie Review</h3>
			<p class="articleauth">Shrey Tyagi • 14 Jun, 2025<p>
			<p>Shrey Tyagi<br>
<p>I hadn’t ever seen the original animated film or even any trailers for the new one (except a long-forgotten 3D teaser years ago at a cinema)… so I went in completely blind.</p>

<p>The story, characters, and performances were so strong… I found myself relating not just to the protagonist but also to his father and friends at various points. The story kept me hooked… something that’s rare nowadays. It’s a very engaging and emotional story.</p>

<p>The CGI, VFX, and locations were flawless… you genuinely can’t tell where the sets end and the extensions begin. Despite being about mythical creatures, it felt surprisingly real and believable.</p>

<p>The 3D was outstanding… perfect conversion with zero artifacts. Strong depth throughout, and every time I removed the glasses, the background–foreground blur difference proved the quality. If this is the kind of 3D @DNEG is bringing to #Superman, I’m excited.</p>

<p>Surround sound mix wasn’t the highlight… the design was good, but mixing was just okay.</p>

<p>The Hindi dubbing was excellent… so natural that I forgot I was even watching a dub. No subtitles at all… which made the 3D even more immersive.</p>

<p>4DX was used brilliantly… and because of the amount and length of aerial scenes, it completely suits the movie. Seat movements synced perfectly with dragon flight… strong wind… water splashes whenever you hit the sea… with that 3D, it honestly felt like I was riding Toothless (no exaggeration).</p>

<p>If you’ve already watched it in IMAX, do a rewatch in 4DX. If there’s no IMAX nearby, I’d strongly recommend going for 4DX.</p>

<p>It’s not just the flying scenes… even the fight scenes had good 4DX timing (though not as tight as Ballerina’s).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Snow was used once when Hiccup lands in a field of cotton flowers</li>
  <li>Smoke was heavily used in the final climax</li>
  <li>Scent was strong in the forest scenes</li>
  <li>Lightning appeared a few times too</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, a great movie… with a near-perfect 4DX + 3D experience.</p>
